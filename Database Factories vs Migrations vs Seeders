Database

Migrations - define the structure of the respective tables
- This is where you create new tables, add columns to existing tables, or modify existing columns
- Migrations are a way to make database changes, and they can be rolled back if needed
- php artisan make:migration create_users_table

Factories - generate large amounts of database records
- Factories are a way to generate fake data for testing purposes
- php artisan make:factory UserFactory

Seeders - populate the database with data
- It is useful for testing or initial data required for the application like roles, permissions, etc.
- php artisan make:seeder UsersTableSeeder
